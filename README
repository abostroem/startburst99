Disclaimer: This code is distributed freely to the community. The user accepts
sole responsibility for the results produced by the code. Although every 
effort has been made to identify and eliminate errors, we accept no 
responsibility for erroneous model predictions. 

The Starburst99 code and the models should be quoted as Leitherer et al. (1999, ApJS, 123, 3) and Vazquez & Leitherer (2005; ApJ, 621, 695). If reference to the Hillier or Pauldrach model atmospheres is made, please quote Smith, Norris, & Crowther (2002).


1. A bit of history

As so often, this code started out as a small project in 1987. Back then, Claus
Leitherer wanted to have a little computer program to calculate ionizing fluxes
for individual O stars. The program evolved from handling a single star to
a whole population. At the same time, there was the desire to assign positions
in the HRD for comparison with observations. Results from this rather simple
code were reported in ApJS, 73, 1 (1990). By 1990 the program had grown to
compute the output of the mechanical luminosity of winds and of supernovae.
A paper on that is in ApJ, 401, 498 (1992). The "real" spectral synthesis 
capability was implemented in 1991, when we added Kurucz and Schmutz model
atmospheres from the far-UV to the near-IR. This allowed us to calculate 
spectra and colors for young populations. Carmelle Robert included an IUE
spectral library in the code in order to compute synthetic lines at 0.75 A 
resolution (ApJ, 418, 749 [1993], ApJS, 99, 173 [1995]). 

By 1994, we had computed so many models, synthesizing all kinds of galaxy
parameters that the suggestion was made to combine everything, plot it in
a homogeneous way, and publish it (ApJS, 96, 9 [1995]). Who would have
predicted that quite a few astronomers found this useful? Later we 
began to add a few more specialized routines, like the computation of O VI
line profiles by Rosa Gonzalez-Delgado (ApJ, 489, 601 [1997]). The most
recent subroutine was written by Jeff Goldader. This part calculates the
strengths of selected stellar features in the near-IR.

After having served us so well over 10 years, it become clear that the code 
needed a major upgrade. Daniel Schaerer replaced the ancient Maeder (1990)
tracks by the most recent (1992-94) model series of Geneva. He also implemented
the capability to perform isochrone synthesis in addition to classical
evolutionary synthesis. One of the subroutines used for this was written by
Georges Meynet. We also decided to take advantage of the homogeneous atmosphere
grid compiled by Lejeune et al. (1997) and replaced the original Kurucz models
by the new set. The updated code was made available to the community via
a spiffy website called Starburst99 (Leitherer et al. 1999, ApJ, 123, 3).

Since then, quite a few important improvements were made. First, Duilia de
Mello added a high-resolution spectral library of B stars in fall 1999. A 
description is in ApJ, 530, 251 (2000). This library replaced the 
low-resolution B-star library we used before. (O stars have always been from a 
high-dispersion library.)

Alessandra Aloisi added supernova yields to the code. Before that, 
only yields from stellar winds were taken into account, and the supernova 
yields of those elements which undergo no nuclear processing during a supernova
explosion. Now the models are up-to-date with respect to the nucleosynthesis
in type II supernovae (and only those -- we don't do type I's yet). This change
was made in August 2000.

Claus Leitherer and summer student Joao Leao Souza added a spectral
library of LMC and SMC stars in August 2000 (Leitherer et al. 2001, ApJ, 550,
724). This allows calculations of models for UV spectra with sub-solar 
metallicities. Only O-stars are used for SMC/LMC metallicity, everything else 
is solar. This is not perfect -- but it is a starting point.

Miguel Cervino, in collaboration with Daniel Schaerer greatly improved
several numerical aspects of the code. In particular he wrote new code to 
handle the calculation of the supernova rate in isochrone synthesis. 
Previously, all SN related parameters showed rather ugly discontinuities due 
to numerical instabilities (see Leitherer et al. 1999). This was fixed in 
October 2000.

Anne Pellerin and Claus Leitherer added a high-resolution spectral library
of hot stars observed with FUSE. The library stars are in the Galaxy, the LMC,
and the SMC. The spectral range is from 1000 to 1183 A, and the structure 
corresponds to that of the IUE/HST stars used at longer wavelengths. The 
library is discussed in Robert et al. (2003).

A major limitation of the original Starburst99 models was removed by Richard 
Norris, Linda Smith, and Paul Crowther. They replaced the unblanketed WR 
atmospheres of Schmutz et al. (1992) by a fully blanketed set calculated with 
John Hillier's code. The updated Starburst99 code, released as v4.0 in July 
2002, gives more realistic EUV fluxes during WR dominated phases.

Starburst99 v5.0 in December 2004 was the most significant upgrade since the 
original Starburst99 code was released. Gerardo Vazquez worked hard to add the 
Padova tracks including thermally pulsing AGB stars to Starburst99. We always 
considered our primary application domain young, OB-star dominated starbursts. 
Most astronomers prefer modeling such phases with the evolutionary tracks from
the Geneva group. Nevertheless, young and old stars often come together, and 
the Geneva models are not optimized for reproducing low-mass stars. Therefore 
we opted for adding the Padova models as well (Vazquez & Leitherer 2005). A 
second major addition was the implementation of a high-resolution optical 
library by Lucimara Martins. This library has a resolution of 0.3 A and 
complements the previous low-resolution library when line profile studies are 
desired (Martins et al. (2005). 

On August 25, 2010 we released Starburst99 v6.0. This version includes a new
subroutine to calculate fully theoretical UV spectra using a library generated
with the WM-Basic code (Leitherer et al. 2010). These models complement and
extend the existing library of empirical spectra. Additional changes in this
version include: replacement of the old Schmidt-Kaler spectral-type calibration
of OB stars by the more modern work of Martins et al. (2005); update of the
subroutine nucleo to account for the SN yields of very massive stars (>40)
in an approximate way. Finally, the code was restructured quite a bit and 
many questionable fortran issues were fixed. 

The latest version is 6.0.4, which has some minor bug fixes.


More to come in the future --- stay tuned!



2. File structure

The package comes with quite a few files. Some are essential whereas others
are not, and one can do without them.

2.1   The README file -- you should read this first.

2.2   galaxy.f -- this is the code. It is standard Fortran 77. Nothing fancy,
      and some software wizards may consider the coding pretty pedestrian.
      Keep in mind the code was written for ourselves and not as shareware for
      the community. The main goal was to make it easily understandable and
      to make the structure be driven by astrophysical requirements. Elegance
      and speed were not our prime concern.

2.3   Makefile -- this file is used to compile the code. You may want to
      tailor this to your need.

2.4   go_galaxy -- this is a script to run the code. Its most important purpose
      is to assign the directories where the auxiliary files reside. You may
      also want to modify this depending on your directory structure.

2.5   save_output --  this is a script to save the output files and give them
      reasonable names. (The input file with the model parameters is also
      included here.) To get started, we suggest to keep the names as they
      are in this file. 

2.6   mod****.dat -- 20 files containing the evolutionary models. There are
      4 groups of 5 files. 1) "c" - Geneva tracks with standard mass-loss
      rates and chemical composition of 2x solar (040), solar (020), 0.4x solar 
      (008), 0.2x solar (004), and 0.05x solar (001); 2) "e" - same as "c" but
      with high mass-loss rates; 3) "s" - Padova tracks as updated by Girardi
      (2000) for chemical composition 0.050, 0.020, 0.008, 0.004, and 0.0004;
      4) "p" - same as "s" but with the inclusion of thermally pulsing AGB stars
      following the prescription of Vassiliadis & Wood (1993).

2.7   lcb97_***.flu -- 5 files containing the model atmospheres of Lejeune et
      al. They match the metallicities of the evolutionary tracks. Note that
      some models were interpolated from the original Lejeune set since
      the required metallicities were not available.

2.8   wr_beta*.fluxes -- 2 files with the WR model atmospheres of Schmutz et 
      al. (1992). 

2.9   CMFGEN*.dat -- 10 files containing the WR models computed by the UCL
      group (5 metallicities, 2 WR types).

2.10  WMbasic*.dat -- 5 files with the Pauldrach O-star atmospheres for 5
      metallicities.

2.11  allstars*.txt -- 9 files in support of the optical high-resulution
      spectra. The files contain the line spectra ("flux"), theoretical
      continua ("cont"), and the wavelength grid ("wave") for the theoretical
      library of Martins et al. (2005). p03, p00, m05, and m10 indicate 
      metallicities of twice solar, solar, 40% solar, and 10% solar.

2.12  ifa_*.txt -- 11 files in support of the theoretical UV spectra. The files
      contain the line spectra ("flux"), continua ("cont"), and the 
      wavelength grid ("wave") for the library of Leitherer et al. (2010).
      p03, p00, m04, m07, and m13 indicate the metallicities of twice solar,
      solar, 40% solar, 20% solar, and 5% solar.  

2.13  sp.dat -- IUE spectral library of O, B, and WR stars used in the 
      subroutine linesyn. This library is also available (in a more readable
      form) via the CD accompanying the article in PASP, 108, 996 (1996), or
      from our web page.

2.14  sp_low.dat -- FOS and STIS spectral library of LMC/SMC O stars used in 
      the subroutine linesyn. The structure is identical to that of sp.dat. 
      All stars other than O stars are the same as in sp.dat. (Leitherer et 
      al. 2001; ApJ, 550, 724.)

2.15  fuse_high.dat -- FUSE spectral library of Galactic O and early B stars 
      used in the subroutine fusesyn. The structure is identical to that of 
      sp.dat. All stars other than O and early B have their continua set to 1.
      
2.16  fuse_low.dat -- same as fuse_high.dat but for LMC and SMC stars. 
      Molecular hydrogen lines were removed. The reference for both FUSE 
      libraries is Robert et al. (2002).

2.17  schkal.dat -- spectral-type calibration of Schmidt-Kaler (1982) and 
      Martins et al. (2005). The table simply contains a list of log L 
      (in solar luminosities) and log Teff (in K). Each line corresponds 
      to a certain spectral type.

2.18  irfeatures.dat -- contains data for the near-IR CO features at 1.62 and
      2.29 microns, and the silicon feature at 1.59 microns from Origlia,
      Moorwood, and Oliva (1993) A&A, 280, 536.

2.19  standard.input1 -- this is the input file specifying the model 
      parameters. It is explained in more detail below.

2.20  standard.* -- results of a standard model run. These files are obtained
      by using the parameters in the galaxy.input file. They can be used for
      test runs when implementing the code.


3. How to run the code

Get organized first. Create a directory for the code and the unix scripts
(files 2.1 -- 2.5). Create separate directories for the evolutionary tracks
(2.6), for the spectral libraries (2.7 -- 2.12), and for the auxiliary files
(2.13 -- 2.18). A directory for the input (2.19) and for the output
(2.20) should also be created. The directory structure should correspond to 
what you have declared in 2.4 and 2.5. The output directory will be populated 
by files produced during a successful run. The source code should be pretty 
much machine independent, except for the names of the auxiliary files which are
called in the code. Search for the string "*** THE FILE NAME IS LOCATION 
DEPENDENT ***" and modify accordingly. If you extract the code and all the
files from the gzipped tar file, you will obtain the same filenames and 
folder structure as at STScI, and little renaming should be required.



3.1 The input

Once all the files are in place and the declarations are complete, the input
parameters need to be specified. If this is your first attempt, we suggest 
to leave the parameters as they are. They produce reasonable results and 
should give you a first impression of what is in store. Once you have gained
more experience and have become more adventurous, you can modify the parameters
to suit your needs. These are the parameters to play with:

MODEL DESIGNATION:                                           [NAME]
standard  -- any identifier you want to assign to the model. You will find
             it in the header of each output file.                 

CONTINUOUS STAR FORMATION (>0) OR FIXED MASS (<=0):          [ISF]
-1  -- if this is a negative integer, star formation is instantaneous, 
       otherwise it is continuous.       

TOTAL STELLAR MASS [10<sup>6</sup> SOLAR MASSES] IF 'FIXED MASS' IS CHOSEN: [TOMA]
1.   -- this is the total stellar mass (spread out between the upper and lower
        cut-off mases). It is only used if an instantaneous burst is specified.

SFR [SOLAR MASSES PER YEAR] IF 'CONT. SF' IS CHOSEN:         [SFR]
1.   -- the star formation rate (only used for a continuous rate). The total
        accumulated mass is spread out between the upper and lower cut-off 
        masses. 

NUMBER OF INTERVALS FOR THE IMF (KROUPA=2):                  [NINTERV]
2    -- intervals of the multi-power-law IMF. If two intervals are specified, 
        the program expects two IMF exponents and three IMF boundaries in the
        next two input fields. Up to ten such intervals may be specified.

IMF EXPONENT(S) (KROUPA=1.3,2.3):                            [XPONENT]
1.3,2.3 -- one or more IMF exponents for a power-law can be specified. The 
           exponents refer to the individual power-law intervals, ordered 
           by increasing mass. 

MASS BOUNDARIES FOR IMF (KROUPA=0.1,0.5,100) [SOLAR MASSES]: [XMASLIM]
0.1,0.5,100. -- the boundaries of the IMF intervals corresponding to the
                specified exponents.

SUPERNOVA CUT-OFF MASS [SOLAR MASSES]:                       [SNCUT]
8.0 -- stars with ZAMS masses of 8 M and higher form supernovae. This is the
       suggested standard value but can be modified if desired.

BLACK HOLE CUT-OFF MASS [SOLAR MASSES]:                      [BHCUT]
120. -- stars with ZAMS masses of 120 M and lower form supernovae. An 
        alternative scenario would be to let stars above a certain threshold
        form a black hole. For instance, BHCUT=40. results in SNe only from the
        mass range 40 to 8 M.

METALLICITY + TRACKS:                                        [IZ]
GENEVA STD: 11=0.001;  12=0.004; 13=0.008; 14=0.020; 15=0.040  
GENEVA HIGH:21=0.001;  22=0.004; 23=0.008; 24=0.020; 25=0.040
PADOVA STD: 31=0.0004; 32=0.004; 33=0.008; 34=0.020; 35=0.050
PADOVA AGB: 41=0.0004; 42=0.004; 43=0.008; 44=0.020; 45=0.050
24 -- this integer indicates the evolutionary tracks to be used. The
      choices are 11-15, 21-25, 31-35, and 41-45, where the numbers indicate
      the metallicity of the four sets of tracks that are available. Example: 
      "23" selects 40% solar metallicity from the Geneva high mass-loss 
      tracks.

WIND MODEL (0: EVOLUTION; 1: EMP.; 2: THEOR.; 3: ELSON):        [IWIND]
2 -- this selects the wind model to be used for the calculation of the
     wind power. The four models are discussed in ApJ, 401, 596 (1992). "0"
     is the suggested default parameter.

INITIAL TIME [1.E6 YEARS]:                                   [TIME1]
0.01 -- the epoch of the onset of the star formation. In almost all cases you
        want this to be close to 0. It should not be exactly 0 for numerical
        reasons. 0.01 (i.e. 10e4 yr) is a good number.

TIME SCALE: LINEAR (=0) OR LOGARITHMIC (=1)                  [JTIME]
0 --  a switch to select linear or logarithmic time intervals.

TIME STEP [1.e6 YEARS] (ONLY USED IF JTIME=0):               [TBIV]  
0.1 --  this is the timestep used for the calculations. It is a very important
        parameter. On the one hand, the computing time scales with STEP, so
        you want to avoid too high resolution, but on the other, short
        evolutionary phases can be missed. 0.1 (i.e. 10e5 yr) is a good 
        value if you use full isochrone synthesis. If full isochrone
        synthesis is not used, 0.1 or large is suggested only for tests
        --- be aware that WR or RSG numbers are no longer properly calculated
        for a STEP of 0.1 unless full ischrone synthesis is selected!       

NUMBER OF STEPS        (ONLY USED IF JTIME=1):               [ITBIV]
1000 -- if a logarithmic scaling is selected, the time step size varies with 
        time and is no longer specified via the TIME STEP field. In this case, 
        we enter the total number of time steps, which will then be distributed
        logarithmically between the first and the last time point. As before, 
        users should beware of too small steps during short-lived evolutionary 
        phases. 

LAST GRID POINT [1.e6 YEARS]:                                [TMAX]
100. -- the oldest age of the model. 

SMALL (=0) OR LARGE (=1) MASS GRID;
ISOCHRONE ON  LARGE GRID (=2) OR FULL ISOCHRONE (=3):        [JMG]
3 -- these are four options for the interpolation in mass. They are explained
     in the code. Shortly: 0 -- evolutionary synthesis with a mass 
     resolution of 5 M (only recommended for tests); 1 -- same as 0, but with
     a resolution of 1 M. This method was used in Leitherer & Heckman (1995); 
     2 -- isochrone synthesis with a fixed mass resolution of 1 M; 
     3 -- isochrone synthesis with a variable mass grid. This is the recommended
     method. In particular, FULL ISOCHRONE must be used if masses below 1 solar 
     masses from the Padova tracks are to be included in the modeling. 

LMIN, LMAX (ALL=0):                                          [LMIN,LMAX]
0 -- LMIN and LMAX are the indices of the evolutionary tracks, sorted by mass.
     Normally you do not want to mess with the variable and leave it at 0. 
     However, if you want to track down some peculiarity of the output, you
     may want to compute the parameters for only one track. For instance, 
     specifying 21,21 indicates that only a 100 M star should be used, and
     everything else is suppressed. The cross-ID's between index and mass
     are at the bottom of the input file. The example here refers to JMG=1 or
     2. For JMG=0, you would have chosen 5,5. This does not apply to JMG=3
     since the mass grid is variable. If JMG=3, LMIN and LMAX are not used.

TIME STEP FOR PRINTING OUT THE SYNTHETIC SPECTRA [1.e6YR]:   [TDEL]
1.0 -- the file containing the output spectrum can be pretty big. This
       parameter controls the time step to print out the spectrum. This is 
       independent of the time resolution -- only the print out is affected!
       1 Myr is usually a good value but if you compute the starburst up to
       100 Myr, you may prefer TDEL=5 Myr unless you have many GB of disk
       space.

ATMOSPHERE FOR THE LOW-RES SPECTRUM: 1=PLA, 2=LEJ, 3=LEJ+SCH, 4=LEJ+HIL, 5=PAU+HIL [IATMOS]
5 -- this is the choice of the model atmosphere. 1 is a bare-bone version with
     black bodies, good only for tests. 2 uses the Kurucz models as compiled
     by Lejeune for all stars. 3 uses Lejeune for stars with plane-parallel
     atmospheres and Schmutz for stars with strong winds. 4 uses Lejeune, 
     but replaces the Schmutz by the Hillier atmospheres. 5 is like 4, except
     for the O atmospheres, for which we use the Pauldrach models. 5 is the 
     recommended value. 

METALLICITY OF THE HIGH RESOLUTION MODELS                    [ILIB]
(1=0.001, 2= 0.008, 3=0.020, 4=0.040):
3 -- a switch to choose the metallicity of the optical high-res spectra. 4
     choices are offered, and the user can decide how to match them to the    
     evolution models.

LIBRARY FOR THE UV LINE SPECTRUM: (1=SOLAR, 2=LMC/SMC)       [ILINE]
1 -- a switch for the choice of the UV spectral library. This switch applies
     to both the FUSE and the HST/IUE libraries. It is independent of the 
     metallicity of the tracks/atmospheres. Normally one would use
     ILINE=1 with IZ=24 and ILINE=2 with IZ=22.

RSG FEATURE: MICROTURB. VEL (1-6), SOL/NON-SOL ABUND (0,1)   [IVT,IRSG]
3,0 -- atmospheric parameters used for the spectral features in the near-IR.
       Detailed explanations are in the sp-feature subroutine. Defaults are
       3,0, i.e. microturbulent velocities of 3 km/sec and solar abundance
       ratios for alpha-element/Fe.

OUTPUT FILES (NO<0, YES>=0)                                  [IO1,...]
+1,+1,-1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1
	These are options to generate various outputs. We recommend to use 
        the default setting for the flags, at least until you become more 
        familiar with the code. Some of the subroutines are interrelated. If 
        you choose such a subroutine but not the other, required one, a warning 
        will be issued. The 15 output flags are explained in the next section.
        They are discussed in the order as they appear above. For instance,
        "(7)" refers to the 7th of the 15 flags.




3.2. The output

(1)   Computation of the number of ionizing photons. (7) must be set to "yes"
      since the spectrum below 912 A is needed. Output is the number of
      ionizing photons in the HI, HeI, and HeII continuum, their fractions
      relative to the total luminosity, and the total luminosity.

(2)   Calculation of the supernova rate and the mechanical luminosities (winds
      and supernovae). It requires (4) to obtain the stellar wind 
      luminosities. Otherwise it is independent of other subroutines. 

(3)   HRD with a few evolutionary tracks. This is mostly useful for test
      purposes. This part is independent of all other subroutines and can be
      turned on/off without doing any harm. The HRD cannot be produced in
      Isochrone Synthesis mode, therefore it is turned off by default.

(4)   Mechanical luminosity and related quantities due to stellar winds. (No
      supernovae!) This does not depend on any other subroutine since no 
      information on the energy distribution is needed.

(5)   Two output files containing the stellar spectral types during each 
      time step and the relative numbers of WR stars. The spectral types follow
      the scheme by Schmidt-Kaler, oversampled by a factor of 2. For instance,
      there are 18 entries for spectral type B. They are the number of stars 
      for types B0, B0.5, B1,...B9.5 (total of 18). Schmidt-Kaler's table has
      B0, B1,....B9 (total of 9). The spectral types are printed out only 
      every TDEL. Otherwise it is too bulky.  

(6)   The mass in individual elements released via stellar winds and 
      supernovae. No other subroutines are needed. The supernova yields for 
      type II supernovae are taken into account.

(7)   The spectrum of the stellar population for each time step. The columns
      are time, wavelength, stellar+nebular, stellar only, and nebular only
      fluxes. (1) is needed in order to calculate the nebular continuum.

(8)   The ultraviolet line spectrum at 0.75 A resolution from 1200 to 1600 A
      (LMC/SMC library) or to 1800 A (Milky Way library). The subroutine needs 
      (7) to compute the stellar continuum and (1) for the nebular continuum. 
      If (1) is turned off, the nebular contribution can not be added (it is 
      often small, though). The columns have time, wavelength, absolute 
      luminosity, and rectified (continuum=1) luminosity.

(9)   Calculation of colors and magnitudes. The subroutine needs (7) to 
      compute the stellar continuum and (1) for the nebular continuum. If (1) 
      is turned off, the nebular contribution can not be added and the computed
      colors are for stars only (this may sometimes be desirable). The filter
      system is defined in the code.

(10)  Calculation of the strengths of H_alpha, H_beta, Pa_beta, and Br_gamma.
      For each line we give the continuum luminosity, the line luminosity,
      and the equivalent width (everything logarithmic). The subroutine needs 
      (7) to compute the stellar continuum and (1) for the number of
      ionizing photons.

(11)  Calculation of the strengths of various IR spectral features.
      First is the CO index as computed by Doyon et al. (1994, ApJ, 421,
      101).  (Please note that this calculation has no metallicity
      dependence.  A later version of this routine will compute the CO
      index using the model atmospheres themselves and give
      metallicity-dependent results.)  Next are two computations of the
      CaII IR triplet using the relations of Diaz et al. (1989, MNRAS, 239, 
      325). The relations from Diaz et al. have no temperature dependence;
      the first calculation has the feature present in stars of all
      temperatures; the second has the index set to zero strength for stars
      with T>7200K (spectral type A or earlier).  Next come the 1.62 and
      2.29 micron CO features, and the 1.59 micron Si feature, which were
      modeled for individual stars by Origlia et al. (1993, A&A, 280,
      536.)  The indices can be computed for solar [Si/Fe] and [C/Fe],
      or a model with enhanced [Si/Fe] and depleted [C/Fe] (as for young
      systems enriched primarily by Type II SNe), and for stellar
      atmospheric microturbulent velocities (MTVs) of 1-6 km/s.  (Note
      that the changes to the abundance ratios and MTVs are 
      self-contained in this routine and have no effect upon the other
      outputs, e.g., colors, of the code.)
      
(12)  This subroutine is equivalent to (8), but it computes the spectral region
      between 1000 and 1180 A.

(13)  Calculates fully theoretical spectra between 3000 and 7000 A at 0.3 A 
      resolution. These spectra are independent of the calculation of the 
      low-resolution spectra in output 7. The file structure is the same as in
      (8). 

(14)  Calculation of the most important WR emission lines. These are only those
      lines originating in WR winds --- not the nebular lines in the HII 
      region. Quantities given are the line fluxes and the equivalent widths. 
      The subroutine needs (7) to compute the stellar continuum and (1) for 
      the nebular continuum. If (1) is turned off, the nebular contribution 
      cannot be added.

(15)  Calculation of a high-resolution UV line spectrum from model atmospheres,
      as opposed to using an empirical library. The output format and units
      are the same as those under (13). The library is discussed by
      Leitherer et al. (2010).
